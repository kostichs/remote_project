This change should show me how will look the history of commits, if 
Laptop repository is behind the head of the remote repo. 
Will be created a new branch, will be shown an error, or anything else? 

Okay, there was an error.

So, but I pulled the commits, now I have message that there is a merge somewhere. I don't see it.
