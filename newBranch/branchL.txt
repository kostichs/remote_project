This change should show me how will look the history of commits, if 
Laptop repository is behind the head of the remote repo. 
Will be created a new branch, will be shown an error, or anything else? 

Okay, there was an error.

So, but I pulled the commits, now I have message that there is a merge somewhere. I don't see it.

Okay I see, to have a clear direct history I need to pull all new commits before pushing my changes into the remote repository.
It's clear at least.

I will make two changes. This is the first one.
